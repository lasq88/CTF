Stage 2 was a system file with flag hex encoded

Stage 3 I suppose the powershell script was intended to add the flag as an Alternate Data Stream, but honestly after simply unpacking the archive with 7zip I got the file as unnamed file. Flag was base64 and hex encoded:

Stage 4 was an executable file with javascript added to the end. Javascript was URL encoded and contained morse code encoded flag:

Stage 5 was a base64 encoded flag inside jpeg file:
